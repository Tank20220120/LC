1602. Find Nearest Right Node in Binary Tree
Medium
Given the root of a binary tree and a node u in the tree, return the nearest node on the same level that is to the right of u, 
or return null if u is the rightmost node in its level.

class Solution {
    private int tDepth;
    private TreeNode target;
    private TreeNode nearest;
    public TreeNode findNearestRightNode(TreeNode root, TreeNode u) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        tDepth = -1;
        target = u;
        nearest = null;
        dfs(root, 0);
        return nearest;
    }
    private void dfs(TreeNode curr, int depth) {
        if (curr == target) {
            tDepth = depth;
            return;
        }
        if (depth == tDepth) {
            if (nearest == null) nearest = curr;
            return;
        }
        if (curr.left != null) dfs(curr.left, depth + 1);
        if (curr.right != null) dfs(curr.right, depth + 1);
    }
}
